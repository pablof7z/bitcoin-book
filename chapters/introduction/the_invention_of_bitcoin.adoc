== The zero-to-one invention of Bitcoin
If you ask people what _is_ Bitcoin's invention is, you'll get a wide array of responses, depending on where they are in their journey of understanding Bitcoin.

A person early in their journey might say it's *_the blockchain_*.

Someone a bit further along might venture it's *_proof of work_*.

Perhaps a person with a very solid understanding will try their luck with *_it's the difficulty adjustment_*.

A more metaphysical answer might come in the form of someone answering it's *_decentralization_*, whatever they might mean by that.

I propose these concepts are just tools. Means to and end.

But what's _the end_? What is it that bitcoin invents that didn't exist before?

My answer?

You might be able to guess it from the next section.

Hint: non-hierarchical money
