= Introduction
"Quick question, Pablo: should I coinjoin my bitcoin?"

The question caught me completely off guard.

_"Eehh, yes. No. Well. Maybe. I don't know!"_

In hindsight, the answer was obviously a nuanced _"MAYBE!"_ but the person asking the question dumbfunded me.

Adrian was my canadian friend and neighbor in Costa Rica, whom I had accidentally orange-pilled over many afternoons hanging out by the pool.

*Thank you, eternal Costa Rican summer.*

He came up to speed on the importance of bitcoin like a thunder. From most people's default of _"bitcoin is a joke"_ to _"I-must-dedicate-my-life-to-hyperbitcoinization!"_

Within months of starting to acquire as much bitcoin as he possibly could he had spent some of his dry-powder to fly to Bitcoin 2022.

"So, should I coinjoin or not?", he repeated impatiently -- we were standing in one of the crowded hallways at the conference and, I'm guessing, he could see my dropped-jaw was not about to emit any astute advice.

Clearly he had gone to a talk about on-chain privacy and was eager to do things *the right way*.

To put things in perspective, I knew for a fact he had done his very first bitcoin transaction a few days ago. I know, I helped him do it.

That's when I decided I needed to write this book.

== Who this book is for
I set out to write this book for the person who is beginning to look into bit

This book is likely for you. If you are relatively new to bitcoin, you might have read one of those fabulous books that posit the investment-thesis for Bitcoin.

"The Bitcoin Standard" by Saifadean Ammous.

Or perhaps even the shorter "The bullish case for Bitcoin" by Va... (the one that pushed Adrian over the orange cliff)

These books make a strong case for the *why* of owning bitcoin.

This book attempts to explain the *how*, and, more importantly, through the *how* to use bitcoin, guide the path towards truly understanding what bitcoin is.

And if you are anything like me and the hundreds of people I've helped *use* bitcoin, using bitcoin might lead you to some very interesting and, perhaps, metaphysical conclusions about the nature of money, value, wealth and languages.

== Bitcoin's Hierarchy of Needs
There's a natural progression of needs and wants on the bitcoiner hero's journey. Each layer builds on top of the previous one, like a pyramid.

Let's call it...

=== Precoiner
"Precoiner" is a friendly name used to refer to people who haven't began looking at bitcoin, even as an investment thesis. Even though most people have _heard_ of bitcoin by now, almost the entire global popullation fits in this category.

=== Bitcoin Derivatives / Bitcoin IOU holder
In the hyper-financialized world we've lived in for the past century, we've become accostumed to

=== Bitcoin User
This is where this book's journey begins. Whether you are currently a bitcoin user or not, here's where we start.

What does it mean to be a bitcoin _user_?

There is one way and one way only to interact with bitcoin, and that is,
through a node. There's no way around it, you either instruct your node to do something or you instruct someone else's node to do it.

The great innovation bitcoin presents is the ability to, without asking for permission from anyone, move your wealth around in a digital form.
