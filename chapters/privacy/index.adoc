Welcome to the chapter that will be skipped the most in this book!

You've arrived. Now, before you skip it, let me give you the elevator-pitch of why you should care about it.

The nature of bitcoin implies that it will attrack powerful adversaries. The only way in which Bitcoin sails into the sunset wihout the ire of the powerful managers of the status quo is if it becomes completely irrelevant.

Using bitcoin privately is not too hard; it's just that most easy ways of using it are terrible for your privacy.



Privacy is a tough topic in bitcoin, but if you follow a handful rules of thumb you'll be able to navigate it.

## Why privacy matters even if...
