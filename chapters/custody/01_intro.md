Bitcoin is the first (and only) digital asset you can truly own. When you custody bitcoin you are ensuring real possession, instead of becoming someone else's liability.

## What is custody, really?
To understand what custody really is we need to understand what a bitcoin is. People are generally thrown off by bitcoin's non-physicallity.

*How can you hold something you can't touch?*

When we refer to custody, what we are really talking about is *the ability to control the destiny of those coins*. If you can **spend** bitcoin then you custody it, if you can't, well, then you don't.

This means that if you need to *request* to spend bitcoin then that's not bitcoin.

Bitcoin is **truly** permissionless; if you need to send a request somewhere to spend bitcoin (e.g. an exchange), you are asking for permission to spend it. All is good when they accept your withdrawal, but someday, as thousands of people painfully learn regularly, they might not.

## Anatomy of a transaction
Bitcoins have a very peculiar way of being spent. When you spend a bitcoin

custody of keys that allow you transfer that asset. You don't really hold the bitcoin, you hold the right to transfer it's ownership, which, incidentally, is the whole point of money.
