# Running a node
Probably right after the popular "not your keys, not your coins", the phrase "not your node, not your rules" is the most widely repeated mantra.

There are many misunderstandings around running a node, what it means, and *why* one should do it.

Here we'll cover:

* Common misconceptions (what it means/what it doesn't mean to run a node)
* The pitch / Why *you* should run a node.

## What it means
Behind all the mysticism of what bitcoin is there simply is *software*.

None of that should make you lose perspective that, underlying all of this, there's just software.

What does it mean to *run a node*? It simply means running the bitcoin software.

## What it *doesn't* mean / Common misconceptions
### You are not protecting the network
Probably the most common misconception, and the one that reflects a larger misunderstanding of how bitcoin work and what it is, is thinking that an individual running a node *protects* the Bitcoin network.

If bitcoin required the good will of a few good samaritans to work, well, then there would be nothing worth protecting.

The only reasons to run a node are selfish reasons: either to learn and experiment or, much more importantly, to protect it's **individual** user.

Let's reflect on this:

> "protect it's **individual** user"

### You (probably) don't need to buy anything
In the past few years, a few 

### Mining
It's also fairly common for people to confuse running a node with mining. These are two independent actions. Think of running a node as *Validating* all transactions, whereas mining can be thought of *Confirming* transactions.
