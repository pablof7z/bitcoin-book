## Running a node
If you've been around Bitcoin for longer than a few hours you've probably heard "not your keys, not your coins" at least half a dozen times.

And if you happen to have been paying attention at Bitcoin for even more than a few hours you've probably heard the throwaway phrase "your own node" a handful of times too.

These words are usually followed by a shopping list and suggestions of the best kind of case for your Raspberry Pi, power consumption recommendations and the kind of Lightning channels you should open.

This is mostly noise around an important subject, so let's expore in the following pages what a node is, but more importantly what it's not.

There are many misunderstandings around running a node, what it means, and *why* one should do it.

Here we'll cover:

* Common misconceptions (what it means/what it doesn't mean to run a node)
* The pitch / Why *you* should run a node.

### What it means
Bitcoin is just software. Like a calculator. You run it in a computer, you use it. Sure, there're some cool emergent properties out of the bitcoin software interacting with some forms of data and physical energy and it's absolutely worth exploring those properties.

None of that should make you lose perspective that, underlying all of this, there's just software.

What does it mean to *run a node*? It simply means running the bitcoin software.

### What it *doesn't* mean / Common misconceptions
#### You are not protecting the network
Probably the most common misconception, and the one that reflects the largest misunderstanding of bitcoin is thinking that an individual running a node *protects* the Bitcoin network.

If bitcoin required the good will of a few good samaritans to work, well, then there would be nothing worth protecting.

The only reasons to run a node are selfish reasons: either to learn and experiment or, much more importantly, to protect it's **individual** user.

Let's reflect on this:

> "protect it's **individual** user"

### You (probably) don't need to buy anything
In the past few years, a few

### Mining
It's also fairly common for people to confuse running a node with mining. These are two independent actions. Think of running a node as *Validating* all transactions, whereas mining can be thought of *Confirming* transactions.
