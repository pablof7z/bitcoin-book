# Your first node
You've decided to run a node: you want to be a fully sovereign individual, not rely on any dodgy third parties. Hooray!

So you Google "how to run a bitcoin node." You are immediately overwhelmed with dozens of projects and offerings, with a list of hardware you need to buy, instructions to flash a Micro SD card, what kind of cables to buy, and the best type of fans for your new node.

Oh, also a deep dive into how to properly manage liquidity on your lightning network node and how to find good channel partners on PLEBNET.

Oops.

Yes, there're many interesting and exciting projects to run dedicated computers to act as your bitcoin node; it doesn't need to be as complicated.
