"Quick question: should I coinjoin my bitcoins?"

The question completely caught me by off guard.

"eehh, yes. No. Well. Maybe. I don't know."

In hindsight, the answer was obviously a nuanced "MAYBE!" but who was asking the question dumbfunded me.

Adrian was my canadian friend and neighbor in Costa Rica, whom I had accidentally orange-pilled over many afternoons hanging-out by the pool.

*Thank you, eternal Costa Rican summer.*

He came up to speed on the importance of bitcoin like a thunder. From most people's default of *"bitcoin is a joke"* to *"oh-my-god-I-must-dedicate-my-life-to-creating-a-bright-orange-future-for-my-children!"*

Within months of starting to acquire as much bitcoin as he possibly could he had spent some of his dry-powder to fly to Bitcoin 2022.

"So, should I coinjoin or not?", he repeated impatiently -- we were standing in one of the crowded hallways at the conference and, I'm guessing, he could see my dropped-jaw was not about to emit any astute advice.

Clearly he had gone to a talk about on-chain privacy and was eager to do things *the right way*.

To put things in perspective, I knew for a fact he had done he's very first bitcoin transaction a few days ago. I know, I helped him do it.

At that very moment I knew I had to write this book.

### Who this book is for
This book is likely for you. If you are relatively new to bitcoin, you might have read one of those fabulous books that posit the investment-thesis for Bitcoin.

"The Bitcoin Standard" by Saifadean Ammous.

Or perhaps even the shorter "The bullish case for Bitcoin" by Va... (the one that pushed Adrian over the orange cliff)

These books make a strong case for the *why* of owning bitcoin.

This book attempts to explain the *how*, and, more importantly, through the *how* to use bitcoin, guide the path towards truly understanding what bitcoin is.

And if you are anything like me and the hundreds of people I've helped *use* bitcoin, using bitcoin might lead you to some very interesting and, perhaps, metaphysical conclusions about the nature of money, value, wealth and languages.

### Why understanding how to use bitcoin is fundamnetal for the investment thesis
I get it.

Every single person that looks at Bitcoin is interested in it's meteoric price appreciation.

Number-go-up. As it's called in Bitcoin circles.

And yes, bitcoin's volatility is all but well-known so you're ready to, as financial planners suggest, "only buy what you're willing to risk" or the less pessimistic "size your exposure according to your risk profile."

This all sounds like sound advice. But is it?

If you look carefully you'll notice the leakage of financial ideas right off the bat.

This is part of the problem.

We've been operating under a monetary system that requires the undoing of one of the most important traits of human civilization: labor specialization. You must know grasp and measure your "risk profile." and size it accordingly. But whatever you do, don't 

## How this book is organized
There's a natural progression of needs and wants on the bitcoiner/hero's journey. Each layer builds on top of the previous one, like a pyramid.

Let's call it...
































# Ok, listen Adrian...
This book is written with someone very specific in mind. My friend Adrian.

I met Adrian by the swimming pool when I was living in Costa Rica. A canadian expat who was ditching the Orwellian state of affairs in his home country.

Because in Costa Rica summer spans basically the entire year, we hanged out a lot and, our conversations would always end up leading back to Bitcoin.

Like the reluctanct orange-pill dispenser I becamse through time, Adrian had a ton of questions.

# Ok, listen Adrian...

The reason I'm writing these words is for my Canadian friend Adrian (named not changed to not-protect his identity).

I had the pleasure of orange-pilling him next to the communal swimming pool while we were neighbors in Costa Rica.

## Why look at bitcoin beyond the investment thesis
Bitcoin is an absolutely incredible... property? asset? technology? phenomenon?
See, any word used to describe bitcoin falls short. Bitcoin stands alone and it would be a noun in of itself if that wouldn't make it a tautology.

This book aims to drive you from a *Bitcoin as an investment* to the depths of the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole (BRH from now on).

This is not just to satisfy some dark intellectual curiosity. I honestly believe, and I'm not alone, that Bitcoin is among the top five most important inventions/discoveries by humans.

This might sound like hyperboly.

It's not. I mean it literally and, I trust, that throughout exploring this book and where your interaction with this book might lead you, to reach a similar conclusion or a strong argument why this is not the case.

At the same time, a deep understanding of the real nature and properties of Bitcoin will harden
your conviction. Bitcoin, as an investment, is not an easy asset to own. It's volatility are like nothing else you might own and, I predict, this volatility will not get better but will get worsen.

For those poor souls who see Bitcoin as a mere number fluctuating in a screen the number rapidly going down can and probably will shake them out of their Bitcoin position.
