Bitcoin is the first (and really only) digital asset you can truly own. When you custody bitcoin you are ensuring real possession, instead of becoming someone else's liability.

## What is custody, really?
To understand what custody really is we need to understand what a bitcoin truly is. People are generally thrown off the rails becuase of the non-physicallity of bitcoin. How can you hold something if you can't touch it?
When we refer to custody, what we are actually talking about is the custody of keys that allow you transfer that asset. You don't really hold the bitcoin, you hold the right to transfer it's ownership, which, incidentally, is the whole point of money.
