# Ok, listen Adrian...

The reason I'm writing these words is for my Canadian friend Adrian (named not changed to not-protect his identity).

I had the pleasure of orange-pilling him next to the communal swimming pool while we were neighbors in Costa Rica.

## Why look at bitcoin beyond the investment thesis
Bitcoin is an absolutely incredible... property? asset? technology? phenomenon?
See, any word used to describe bitcoin falls short. Bitcoin stands alone and it would be a noun in of itself if that wouldn't make it a tautology.

The aim of this book is to drive you from a *Bitcoin as an investment* to the depths of the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole (BRH from now on).

This is not just to satisfy some dark intellectual curiosity. I honestly believe, and I'm not alone, that Bitcoin is among the top ten most important inventions/discoveries by humans. I know, this might sound like hyperboly.

It's not. I mean it literally and, I trust, that throughout exploring this book and where your interaction with this book might lead you, to reach a similar conclusion or a strong argument why this is not the case.

At the same time, a deep understanding of the real nature and properties of Bitcoin will harden
your conviction. Bitcoin, as an investment, is not an easy asset to own. It's volatility are like nothing else you might own and, I predict, this volatility will not get better but will get worsen.

For those poor souls who see Bitcoin as a mere number fluctuating in a screen the number rapidly going down can and probably will shake them out of their Bitcoin position.
