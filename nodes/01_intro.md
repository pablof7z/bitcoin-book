# Running a node

Similar to the popular "not your keys, not your bitcoin", among bitcoiners the phrase "not your node, not your rules"
is a pretty fashionable one.

There are many misunderstandings around running a node, what it means, and *why* one should do it.

Here we'll cover:

* Common misconceptions (what it means/what it doesn't mean to run a node)
* The pitch / Why *you* should run a node.

## What id *doesn't* mean

### Not protecting the network
Probably the most common misconception, and the one that indicates the a larger misunderstanding of how bitcoin work and what it is, is thinking that an individual running a node *protects* the Bitcoin network.

If bitcoin required the good will of a few good samaritans to work, well, then there would be nothing worthwhile to protect. The only reasons to run a node are selfish reasons: either to learn and experiment or, more importantly, to protect it's individual user.

### Mining
It's also fairly common for people to confuse running a node with mining. These are two independent actions. Think of running a node as *Validating* all transactions, whereas mining can be thought of *Confirming* transactions.
