# Bitcoin 201 book

> Truly understand what bitcoin is beyond faulty analogies by securely interacting with the bitcoin network and realizing what bitcoin is to you.

Bitcoin 201 is a book I ([pablof7z](https://pablof7z.com/)) started writing in 2022. This is a very early work-in-progress.

It's purpose is to help people who understand the financial/ideological reason to protect your families' wealth from cleptocratic/abusive governments but are not comfortable *using* the bitcoin software.

I'm not writing this book for the NgU crowd, although they might also benefit from it, but this is 100% not the persona I have in mind since I don't consider that people to be ready to really commit to studying bitcoin beyond a financial asset.

The persona I have in mind is the people who read a book like "The price of tomorrow" and understand what it says.

My thesis is that once people who have this understanding, preparing them to use bitcoin will:

* increase their confidence in holding bitcoin
* prepare them to interacting with the freedom economy
