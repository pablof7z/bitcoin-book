### Quotes

"Hi Pablo- loved your talk with pysh - one thing I would love u to include in your new book is to provide a way to talk through my wife how to get the coins out if I die. I guess it’s what hopefully your book will be about it sounds like a great idea - I’ve signed up to your subscription and looking forward to reading it! I am also running a node with umbrel - and I still don’t know what im doing - much like you said in the interview! I would love to read something that walks through how to cold store  using your own node explaining the keys and how it all works - I feel only 50% of understanding and also setting up a lightning channel would be great to do and how to avoid loosing any bitcoin. Thanks for your work!"
